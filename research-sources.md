**Key Points**:
- LLM applications require different architectural approaches than traditional microservices
- Data drift can silently break AI systems without proper monitoring
- Prompt versioning is essential for maintaining system reliability
- Multi-agent systems need specialized coordination mechanisms
- Focus on better architectures rather than adding more tools
